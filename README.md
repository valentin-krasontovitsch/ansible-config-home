# Ansible configuration for our home

This repo contains the ansible configuration for our home, including laptops
and raspberry pies

It contains (in `infrastructure.yml`, unless specified otherwise)

- initial setup (`init.yml`)
- basic setup
- optimization
- docker setup

The inventory is described in `hosts`.

We lean on the ansible config of MGM at HUS in Bergen, Norway - shoutout to
